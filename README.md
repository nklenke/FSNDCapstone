# Casting Agency backend
This application was created to allow different employees of a casting agency to manage actors and movies.  The API can be found at https://nklenke-casting-agency.herokuapp.com

## Getting Started

### Installing Dependencies

#### Python 3.7

Follow instructions to install the latest version of python for your platform in the [python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python)

#### Virtual Enviornment

We recommend working within a virtual environment whenever using Python for projects. This keeps your dependencies for each project separate and organaized. Instructions for setting up a virual enviornment for your platform can be found in the [python docs](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)

#### PIP Dependencies

Once you have your virtual environment setup and running, install dependencies by naviging to the project directory and running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all of the required packages we selected within the `requirements.txt` file.

##### Key Dependencies

- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)  is a lightweight backend microservices framework. Flask is required to handle requests and responses.

- [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) is the Python SQL toolkit and ORM we'll use handle the lightweight sqlite database. You'll primarily work in app.py and can reference models.py. 

- [Flask-CORS](https://flask-cors.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) is the extension we'll use to handle cross origin requests from our frontend server. 

## Database Setup
This application uses a postgres database that was created at deployment time.  No setup is necessary.  If running locally, you will need to create a postgres database called casting_agency and execute:
```
python manage.py db upgrade
```

## Running the server

From within the project directory first ensure you are working using your created virtual environment.

To run the server, execute:

```bash
export FLASK_APP=app.py
export FLASK_ENV=development
flask run
```

Setting the `FLASK_ENV` variable to `development` will detect file changes and restart the server automatically.

Setting the `FLASK_APP` variable to `app.py` directs flask to use the `app.py` file to run the application. 

### Get tokens and update in tests
1. Open the following link in a browser: https://nkcoffee.auth0.com/authorize?audience=actorsAndMovies&response_type=token&client_id=zpizdFNFV6UnzgsReSwZwPM1UzVM3QT3&redirect_uri=http://localhost:8100
2. 3 Users have been created with their respective roles.  Each uses the password p@$$w0rd
    - Casting Assistant
        - Email Address: udacityFSNDCapstoneCastingAssistant@yahoo.com
        - Can view actors and movies
    - Casting Director
        - Email Address: udacityfsndcapstonecastingdirector@yahoo.com
        - All permissions a Casting Assistant has and…
        - Add or delete an actor from the database
        - Modify actors or movies
    - Executive Producer
        - Email Address: udacityFSNDCapstoneExecutiveProducer@yahoo.com
        - All permissions a Casting Director has and…
        - Add or delete a movie from the database
3. Once logged in, get the token parameter from the callback url
4. To run unit tests, update the token for each role in test_app.py
5. To test endpoints with [Postman](https://getpostman.com). 
    - Import the postman collection `./UdacityFSNDCapstone.postman_collection.json`
    - Navigate to the authorization tab and update the token in the folder for the respective user noted in the name.  Tests targeted at the Heroku server are noted as such in parentheses.  The other tests point to a local instance of the application.
